## Customer Churn Prediction using ANN
 
This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn (exit) from a bank or not using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The prediction is based on various customer features such as demographics, account details,credit-score  and banking behavior.
 
 
### Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical problem faced by businesses, especially in the banking sector. The goal of this project is to use machine learning and deep learning techniques, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), to predict whether a customer will churn or remain based on their profile data.
### Dataset Details
The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

CustomerId: Unique ID for each customer.

Surname: Customer's last name.

CreditScore: Customer's credit score.

Geography: Customer's country.

Gender: Male or Female.

Age: Customer's age.

Tenure: Number of years the customer has been with the bank.

Balance: Bank balance of the customer.

NumOfProducts: Number of products the customer is using.

HasCrCard: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 for yes, 0 for no).

IsActiveMember: Whether the customer is an active member (1 for yes, 0 for no).

EstimatedSalary: Estimated salary of the customer.

Exited: Whether the customer exited (1 for churn, 0 for staying).
### Model
An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is built to solve this binary classification problem. The model is built using the following steps:

Data Preprocessing

Feature Encoding (OneHotEncoder for categorical variables and LabelEncoder for gender)

Scaling of features using StandardScaler

ANN with multiple dense layers
### Dependencies
To run this project, the following Python libraries are required:

Python 3.9  

Streamlit 

TensorFlow

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Pickle

You can install these dependencies using the following command:
 
```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```
